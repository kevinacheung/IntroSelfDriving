# Project 2 - Implementing a Matrix Class
In this project I learned about creating classes in Python specifically for operating on 1x1 and 2x2 matricies.
This was part of learning about Kalman Filters and their application in self-driving car localization.  

Please see code that I wrote under To Do in 'matrix.py'
